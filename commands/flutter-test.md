# Flutter Test
> 🇹🇼 命令指示

This command runs the Flutter test suite and reports results. When failures occur, it diagnoses and fixes issues incrementally.

## What This Command Does
> 🇹🇼 命令指示

1. **Run Tests**: Execute `flutter test` (or scope to changed files)
2. **Parse Failures**: Identify failing tests by type and cause
3. **Fix Incrementally**: One failure at a time where possible
4. **Verify**: Re-run after each fix
5. **Report**: Show coverage summary and remaining failures

## When to Use
> 🇹🇼 命令指示

Use `/flutter-test` when:
- After implementing a feature to verify nothing broke
- After running `/flutter-build` to ensure tests pass
- To check test coverage on new code
- When a specific test file is failing
- Before submitting a PR

## Commands Run
> 🇹🇼 命令指示

```bash
# Run all tests
> 🇹🇼 命令指示
flutter test 2>&1

# Run with coverage
> 🇹🇼 命令指示
flutter test --coverage 2>&1

# Run specific test file
> 🇹🇼 命令指示
flutter test test/unit/domain/usecases/get_user_test.dart 2>&1

# Run tests matching a name pattern
> 🇹🇼 命令指示
flutter test --name "CartBloc" 2>&1

# Run integration tests (requires device/emulator)
> 🇹🇼 命令指示
flutter test integration_test/ 2>&1

# Update golden files when intentional visual changes are made
> 🇹🇼 命令指示
flutter test --update-goldens 2>&1
```

## Test Execution
> 🇹🇼 命令指示

```
$ flutter test
00:05 +42 -2: Some tests failed.

FAILED: test/unit/data/user_repository_test.dart
  UserRepository getById
    returns null when user not found
    Expected: null
    Actual: User(id: 'test-id', name: 'Test User')

FAILED: test/widget/cart_page_test.dart
  CartPage
    shows empty state when cart is empty
    Expected: exactly one widget with text 'Your cart is empty'
    Found: no widget with text 'Your cart is empty'
```

## Fix 1: Repository Test
> 🇹🇼 命令指示

File: test/unit/data/user_repository_test.dart
Failure: `getById` returns a user when it should return null for missing ID

Root cause: Test setup adds a user with ID 'test-id' but queries with 'missing-id'.
Fix: Updated test to query with 'missing-id' — setup was correct, query was wrong.

```
$ flutter test test/unit/data/user_repository_test.dart
1 test passed.
```

## Fix 2: Widget Test
> 🇹🇼 命令指示

File: test/widget/cart_page_test.dart
Failure: Empty state text widget not found

Root cause: Empty state message was renamed from 'Your cart is empty' to 'Cart is empty' in the widget.
Fix: Updated test string to match current widget copy.

```
$ flutter test test/widget/cart_page_test.dart
1 test passed.
```

## Final Run
> 🇹🇼 命令指示

```
$ flutter test --coverage
All 44 tests passed.
Coverage: 84.2% (target: 80%)
```

## Common Test Failures
> 🇹🇼 命令指示

| Failure | Typical Fix |
|---------|-------------|
| `Expected: <X> Actual: <Y>` | Update assertion or fix implementation |
| `Widget not found` | Fix finder selector or update test after widget rename |
| `Golden file not found` | Run `flutter test --update-goldens` to generate |
| `Golden mismatch` | Inspect diff; run `--update-goldens` if change was intentional |
| `MissingPluginException` | Mock platform channel in test setup |
| `LateInitializationError` | Initialize `late` fields in `setUp()` |
| `pumpAndSettle timed out` | Replace with explicit `pump(Duration)` calls |
